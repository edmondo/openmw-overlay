Overlay with ebuilds for openmw

Howto use the overlay
=====================

* Create locally a clone of the overlay

  mkdir SOMEDIR
  cd SOMEDIR
  git clone git://github.com/edmondo/openmw-overlay.git

* Set the PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable into you /etc/make.conf

  PORTDIR_OVERLAY="SOMEDIR/openmw-overlay/"

* Emerge the needed packages

  emerge bullet
  emerge nvidia-cg-toolki
  USER="cg" emerge ogre
  emerge MyGUI mgp123 libsndfile
  emerge openmw

* Since at the moment openmw is missing the install rule, you will get an error.
  Red is scary and yes, my ebuild is a crap and sucks. Don't lose your hope and
  just give the rights to your preferred user to access the workdir of the build.

  For example:
  chmod 755 /var/tmp/portage/games-rpg/openmw-9999/work

* Set a symbolic link to your morrowind Data File

  ln -s /games/morrowind/Data\ Files/ /var/tmp/portage/games-rpg/openmw-9999/work/openmw-9999_build/data

* Now with your preferred user access the build directory and start openmw

  cd /var/tmp/portage/games-rpg/openmw-9999/work/openmw-9999_build
  
  ./omwlauncher
  or
  ./openmw

* Enjoy!
